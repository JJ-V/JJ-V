grim3212.manual.ultimatefist.subsection.ultimate.page.fist=The Ultimate Fist is a weapon and a tool that is very over-powered. The damage that it deals is configurable but starts out being able to one hit an Ender Dragon. The tool aspect by default is able to insta-mine blocks but, like the weapon part how fast it mines is also configurable.
